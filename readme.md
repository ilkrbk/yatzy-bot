# Yatzy bot

A game of dice, reminiscent in part of DICE POKER. The game can be played by one person or more. The game will require 5 dice and a specially drawn sheet of paper to record points. The aim of the game is to score the maximum number of points by throwing certain combinations on five dice.
For each move, the player has the right to roll the dice no more than three times, although he has the right to stop after the first or second roll, if the result satisfies him. For the first roll, the player must leave all 5 dice. After studying the result of the throw, the player decides which dice to leave and which to throw again. The same for the third time.
After the third roll, the player must write in the table to record which combination he threw. After recording, the turn goes to the next player.
